  "body": "#Parkour-Link\r\n\r\n##What it is\r\nParkour-Link is an app aimed at traceurs and freerunners to provide a new level of commuication between practitioners of these extreme sports.\r\n\r\n##What it does\r\nParkour-Link is mainly aimed to provide a database of sites and tracks for traceurs and freerunners to share. Users can search for local Points-of-Interest and even contact other practitioners in the area to team up.\r\nWhile there are many social features, there will also be privacy options to a degree where you can post and recieve data fully anonymously.\r\nCurrently, it is only being developed for Android, but Versions for Android Wear, IOS or Tizen are possible.\r\n\r\n##How it works\r\nParkour-Link employs the Google-Maps API to create a basis for its operation. Users can upload locations or routes (i.e. tracks) into the P2P network. There is no central Server. As long as one other user is connected, the Network is up. Parkour-Link encodes all Data into a blockchain-like system, so every user has all the (highly compressed) data.\r\n\r\n##Who is developing it\r\nThe project is published under the GPLv3 and therefore fully open-source. Everyone can contribute and change it as they see fit.\r\n\r\n##Status\r\nParkour-Link is still in very early development.",
